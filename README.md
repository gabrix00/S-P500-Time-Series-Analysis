# S&P500 Time Series Analysis
Time Series Forcasting of S&amp;P500 Index through ARIMA model and its comparison with Xgboost and Persistance models.

Overview
This project aims to compare the performance of traditional statistical and modern machine learning models for time series forecasting, specifically focusing on one-day predictions. We will evaluate an ARIMA model, an XGBoost model, and a simple persistence model (assuming tomorrow will be like today) on a S&P500 Index time series dataset.
